In the Server configs you will find the basic templates for the QL Configs that I use for my Clan Arena servers.

The Server Scripts folder you will find factories and mappools

In the factories folder you will find some game type scripts that I have edited or made for Quake Live. These scripts change the gameplay mechanics in some way or another. These files go on you server in /baseq3/scripts/ folder.

The mappool scripts are for map rotation and end of match voting if enabled in you server.cfg. These scripts go in you /baseq3/ folder and are referenced in the server cfg in the ' set sv_mapPoolFile "" ' variable.


Enjoy.
