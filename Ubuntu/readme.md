UBUNTU 18.04 QL SERVER SETUP

This is the ql server setup shell script to setup a QuakeLive server on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Download this to your VPS and then 'sudo chmod +x QLx64_single_server.sh' to make it executable.
Next type ./QLx64_single_server.sh to begin installation of the required files and programs to run a dedicated QuakeLive server

The script will create a well documented and sorted 'server.cfg' config for your dedicated QuakeLive server.

You can use your favorite linux text editor to make changes to the server config portion of the script before you execute it.
You do not have to do this in the script if you are not comfortable editing shell scripts. You can just edit the server config before you reboot
the VPS.

After the script is finished running you should send the reboot command to the server and allow linux to start up normally.

Happy Fraging,
