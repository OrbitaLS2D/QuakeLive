Hi this is my repository full of NOOBERY. I started with a fork rcb and created this for my own personal use. 
But i believe som of this stuff may help some one down the road and i enjoy tinkering with all of this crap in here.
These files have been edited by me and if these may help you then by all means please use these.
I have included these files and here is a quick description of what they do.

For Debian Quake Live dedicated server setup have a look at the readme.md in the Debian folder.
For Ubuntu Quake Live dedicated server setup have a look at the readme.md in the ubuntu folder.

I'm sure that as I learn and do more there will be more here than this junk :D
